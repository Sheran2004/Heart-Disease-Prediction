# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of heart disease using Logistic Regression implemented in SAS Studio. The goal is to analyze medical attributes and build a statistical model that classifies whether a patient is at risk of heart disease.

🎯 Objectives:
- Perform data cleaning and preparation
- Explore medical dataset variables
- Apply Logistic Regression for classification
- Evaluate model performance
- Interpret probability-based predictions

🛠️ Technologies Used:
- SAS Studio
- SAS Programming
- Logistic Regression
- Statistical Modeling

📊 Model Description
Logistic Regression is used because the target variable is binary (Heart Disease: Yes/No). The model estimates the probability of heart disease based on clinical features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressur
- Cholesterol
- Chest Pain Type
- Maximum Heart Rate
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- And other relevant medical attributes

The output provides:
- Probability scores
- Classification results
- Model summary statistics

🚀 How to Run:
- Open SAS Studio (SAS OnDemand for Academics recommended)
- Upload the .sas file
- Upload the dataset file
- Run the program
- View results in the output window

📈 Key Learning Outcomes:
- Practical implementation of Logistic Regression in SAS
- Understanding classification problems
- Data preprocessing in SAS
- Statistical interpretation of model results
